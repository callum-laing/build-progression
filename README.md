Q1. Create the logic of an inventory management system, to list all products, to be able to add a product, update the amount, and ultimately remove it (only if the supply is at 0). Put this in a singular module/class
A1. This is now complete under inventoryManagement.js

2. Without touching a single line of code from step 1, implement this module in a console app that the user can interface with.

3. Without touching a single line of code from step 1, implement this module in a web app that the user can interface with.

The idea is we can take the exact same logic/code from step 1, and then create a user interface around it, but have the user interface be different.
